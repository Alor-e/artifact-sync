# Artifact Sync

Artifact Sync pairs a packaged VS Code extension with a Python analysis agent to surface change-impact insights directly inside the editor. The tool inspects recent repository changes, highlights impacted files, and (optionally) generates remediation guidance or fixes.

---

## Quick Start for Reviewers

1. **Download the extension** – Grab `ArtifactSyncAssistant.vsix` from the repository root or [download it directly](ArtifactSyncAssistant.vsix).
2. **Install in VS Code** – Launch VS Code (v1.84+), open the Extensions view, choose “Install from VSIX…”, and select the file.
3. **Open a repository** – Load the project you want to analyze in VS Code. Ensure Python 3.10+ is available on your machine.
4. **Set an API key** – Run the command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd` + `Shift` + `P`) → `Artifact Sync: Set API Key`, then paste an OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google Gemini token. Secrets are stored securely via VS Code’s secret storage.
5. **Run the dashboard** – Execute `Artifact Sync: Open Dashboard` from the command palette and press **Run Artifact Sync** to launch an analysis. Logs stream live in the Activity Log panel.

## What You’ll See

- **Header controls** for running analyses and toggling advanced settings.
- **Summary metrics**: provider, repository path, start time, token usage, and “needs follow-up” notes.
- **Impacted Files list** with confidence/impact badges, recommended actions, and one-click fix generation.
- **Activity Log** streaming the agent’s progress (context building, refinement iterations, fix application, etc.).

Results live inside the dashboard session. Close and reopen the panel whenever you want a fresh run; API keys persist between sessions.

## Feature Highlights

- **Unified LLM orchestration** – Seamlessly targets OpenAI, Google Gemini, or Anthropic models through a single provider layer.
- **Repository-context prompts** – Supplies directory trees, diff summaries, and README excerpts so the agent understands project structure.
- **Parallel refinement** – Handles uncertain files in batches, escalating from structural overviews to raw content only when needed.
- **Optional fix generation** – Produces whole-file patches for artifacts flagged as “Needs Update,” saving them for manual review.
- **Secure credentials** – API keys are stored in VS Code’s encrypted secret storage; the repository never contains keys in plain text.

```

The Python backend retains its own detailed README (`change-impact-agent/README.md`) for CLI usage; no reviewer-only instructions are necessary there.

## Behind the Scenes

- When the dashboard runs, the extension provisions a virtual environment in VS Code’s global storage and installs dependencies from `change-impact-agent/requirements.txt` automatically.
- `PythonBridge` handles spawning `main.py`, streaming logs, applying generated fixes via `WorkspaceEdit`, and caching settings between runs.
- Theme-aware CSS/JS assets inside `media/` keep the UI aligned with VS Code light/dark/high-contrast themes.

## Maintainer Notes

If you need to regenerate the VSIX before sharing the repository:

```bash
cd vscode-extension
npm install --save-dev @vscode/vsce   # only once
npm run package
mkdir -p dist
cp artifact-sync-assistant-0.0.1.vsix dist/ArtifactSyncAssistant.vsix
cp artifact-sync-assistant-0.0.1.vsix ../ArtifactSyncAssistant.vsix
```

Update the version number in `package.json` (and the copy commands) if you publish a new release.
